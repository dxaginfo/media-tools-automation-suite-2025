# SceneValidator

SceneValidator is a specialized tool for validating scene composition and continuity in media projects.

## Overview

SceneValidator uses computer vision and AI algorithms to analyze video scenes and ensure proper composition, lighting consistency, and continuity between shots. It helps identify potential issues that may disrupt viewer experience, such as jump cuts, lighting mismatches, or composition errors.

## Features

- Scene composition analysis based on cinematography principles
- Lighting consistency detection across scenes
- Object and actor position tracking for continuity
- Color grading consistency validation
- Automatic report generation with timestamped issues
- Integration with popular video editing software

## Implementation

SceneValidator is implemented using:
- Gemini API for scene analysis and anomaly detection
- Google Cloud Vision API for object detection and tracking
- Firebase for report storage and user authentication
- Static HTML/JS interface for web-based validation

## Trigger Mechanisms

SceneValidator can be triggered through:
1. File upload via web interface
2. Webhook from video editing software
3. Scheduled batch processing
4. Command-line interface for automation
5. API integration with media asset management systems

## Input/Output Schema

### Input
- Video files (MP4, MOV, AVI)
- Scene metadata (JSON)
- Validation parameters (JSON)
- Reference frames (optional)

### Output
- Validation report (JSON, HTML, PDF)
- Timestamped issue markers
- Visual comparison data
- Suggested fixes
- Integration data for other tools

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Google Cloud SDK
- Firebase SDK

## Sample Usage

```python
from scene_validator import SceneValidator

validator = SceneValidator(
    api_key="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY",
    cloud_project="YOUR_GCP_PROJECT",
    firebase_config="path/to/firebase_config.json"
)

# Process a video file
report = validator.validate_video(
    video_path="path/to/video.mp4",
    sensitivity=0.8,
    check_composition=True,
    check_lighting=True,
    check_continuity=True
)

# Export results
report.export_html("validation_report.html")
report.export_json("validation_data.json")

# Get specific issues
lighting_issues = report.get_issues_by_type("lighting")
for issue in lighting_issues:
    print(f"Lighting issue at {issue.timestamp}: {issue.description}")
```

## Integration Points

SceneValidator integrates with:
- **TimelineAssembler** - For scene sequencing validation
- **ContinuityTracker** - For detailed continuity analysis
- **FormatNormalizer** - For ensuring consistent video formats
- **StoryboardGen** - For comparing shots against storyboards

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored securely in environment variables
- User authentication required for web interface
- Role-based access control for team environments
- Data encryption for sensitive project metadata
